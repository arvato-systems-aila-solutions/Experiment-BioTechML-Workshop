    "### 🎯 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Exploration** (15 min) - Understanding your dataset\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning** (20 min) - Handling messy real-world data\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering** (15 min) - Creating useful features\n",
    "4. **Data Preparation** (10 min) - Getting ready for ML\n",
    "5. **Model Training** (25 min) - Building multiple models\n",
    "6. **Model Evaluation** (10 min) - Comparing performance\n",
